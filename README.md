# ðŸŽ¬ Module 1 Mini-Project: Predicting Movie Revenue from Budget

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project is part of my Data Science Mini-Project series.  
It demonstrates the complete data science workflow â€” from **data cleaning** and **exploration** to **model building**, **evaluation**, and **interpretation** â€” using the **TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset** from Kaggle.

The main goal of this analysis is to **predict a movieâ€™s total revenue based on its production budget** using a **Linear Regression model**.
